## **1. Core AWS Services for DevOps**

### EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

* Virtual servers in the cloud
* Can be used to host CI/CD tools, Jenkins, GitLab Runners, etc.
* Key Features: AMIs, Security Groups, Auto Scaling, Elastic IPs

### S3 (Simple Storage Service)

* Object storage for storing build artifacts, logs, backups
* Common use: store deployment packages for Lambda/CodeDeploy
* Versioning and lifecycle policies are critical for automation

### IAM (Identity and Access Management)

* Controls access to AWS resources
* Use roles over long-term credentials
* Apply principle of least privilege
* Integrate IAM with CI/CD roles (e.g., CodeBuild, EC2)

### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

* Isolated network for hosting services securely
* Includes Subnets, Route Tables, NAT Gateways, Security Groups
* DevOps use: secure deployment environments, internal services

### CloudWatch

* Monitoring and observability service
* Logs: collect logs from EC2, Lambda, etc.
* Metrics: monitor CPU, memory, custom metrics
* Alarms: trigger actions like notifications or scaling

## **2. DevOps Toolchain in AWS**

### CodeCommit

* Git-based source control system
* Alternative to GitHub/GitLab for AWS-native environments

### CodeBuild

* Continuous integration service that builds and tests code
* Uses `buildspec.yml` to define build steps

```yaml
version: 0.2
phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - echo Installing...
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Building...
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
```

### CodeDeploy

* Automates application deployments to EC2, Lambda, or ECS
* Supports in-place and blue/green deployments
* Requires `appspec.yml` to define deployment steps

### CodePipeline

* Automates the entire release process
* Integrates with CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, S3, Lambda
* Pipeline stages: Source ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy

### Elastic Beanstalk

* PaaS to deploy applications without managing infrastructure
* Supports auto-scaling, monitoring, rollback

### CloudFormation

* Infrastructure as Code service using JSON/YAML
* Define full stack: EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, etc.

### Terraform (3rd-party tool)

* Popular IaC tool that works with AWS via providers
* Benefits: modular, reusable, state management

## **3. Containers & Orchestration**

### ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

* Docker container registry for storing images

### ECS (Elastic Container Service)

* Run and manage Docker containers
* Fargate: serverless compute for containers

### EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

* Managed Kubernetes on AWS
* Use with IaC (Terraform, eksctl)

---

## **4. Serverless DevOps**

### AWS Lambda

* Run code without managing servers
* Use for automation, deployment hooks, cron jobs

### API Gateway

* Expose Lambda functions as REST APIs

### EventBridge

* Event-driven automation
* Example: Trigger Lambda when CodeBuild fails

---

## **5. Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing**

### CloudWatch Logs & Metrics

* Collect logs from EC2, Lambda, ECS
* Create custom metrics and dashboards

### CloudTrail

* Logs all API activity in your account
* Important for auditing and compliance

### AWS X-Ray

* Distributed tracing for microservices

---

## **6. Security & Governance**

### IAM Policies

* Use scoped permissions for services
* Avoid wildcard (\*) permissions

### Secrets Manager & SSM Parameter Store

* Store and rotate credentials, API keys

### AWS Config

* Monitors configuration changes
* Ensures compliance with policies

---

## **7. Automation & Scheduling**

### CloudWatch Events / EventBridge

* Automate builds, backups, cleanups

### Step Functions

* Orchestrate complex workflows (e.g., approval-based deployment)

---

## **8. Sample DevOps Architecture in AWS**

1. **CodeCommit**: Developer pushes code
2. **CodePipeline**: Orchestrates the workflow
3. **CodeBuild**: Runs build & test
4. **S3**: Stores artifacts
5. **CodeDeploy**: Deploys to EC2 or Lambda
6. **CloudWatch**: Monitors performance
7. **X-Ray**: Traces execution paths

---

## **9. Best Practices**

* Use Infrastructure as Code for repeatability
* Automate testing and deployments
* Secure credentials with IAM and Secrets Manager
* Use multi-account strategy for dev/staging/prod
* Set up monitoring, logging, and alerts early
